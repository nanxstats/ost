# Sans Serif

Sans serif typefaces are known for their clean, minimalist lines, and
excellent readability. Sans Serif fonts lack the decorative strokes found
in their serif counterparts, creating a more contemporary and approachable look.
They are ideal for conveying clarity, simplicity, and a modern aesthetic in
your designs.
