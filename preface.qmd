## Acknowledgements {-}

The [editable text component code](https://github.com/nanxstats/fonts/tree/main/assets/ctxedit)
is derived from "CtxEdit" used on the [Inter samples website](https://rsms.me/inter/samples/)
([GitHub repo](https://github.com/rsms/inter/tree/master/docs)) by Rasmus Andersson.
The main change here is we disabled the [dynamic tracking feature](https://rsms.me/inter/dynmetrics/)
so that the parameters (font size, tracking, and line height) are decoupled in the sample text.
