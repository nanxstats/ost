## Why this lookbook

As a designer or developer, you likely have come across high-quality open source
typefaces on platforms like Google Fonts, only to forget about them later when
they could have been the perfect fit for a project.
This book was born out of that very frustration: the need for an easily
accessible reference for those beautiful, functional, and open source
typefaces that sometimes slip through memory.

## What is included

This project serves as an interactive lookbook for designers
and developers, allowing you to quickly browse through fonts,
experiment with them, and discover new options for your creative projects.
The typefaces featured in this book have been handpicked based on
a set of criteria designed to ensure they are truly useful and valuable
additions to your design toolkit.

The basic selection criteria for the typefaces featured in this book are:

1. Free license: focus on fonts that are available under open licenses,
   ensuring they are suitable for a wide range of projects without any
   legal concerns.
2. [Reliable design](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/choosing_type/choosing_reliable_typefaces):
   Legibility, readability, a variety of weights and styles are crucial
   factors in determining the usefulness of a font.
   I have selected typefaces that excel in these areas,
   allowing you to confidently implement them in your work.
3. Not too overused: While it is true that many open source fonts are
   widely used, I have aimed to showcase those that are relatively less
   overused, especially when proper variants and combinations are chosen.
   This subtle distinction allows you to bring a fresh and distinctive
   touch to your projects.

By compiling these typefaces into a single, easy-to-navigate resource,
I hope to provide you with a valuable tool for creative expression.
Whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting out,
this lookbook is designed to help you discover and utilize the
best open source typography has to offer.

## How to experiment with typeface appearance

In this lookbook, I have made it easy for you to experiment with the appearance
of the fonts in real-world settings. In chapters featuring serif and sans serif
fonts, you will find editable example text components that demonstrate how the
font might look in various contexts.

To customize the appearance of these text components, simply click on the
text you would like to modify. A popup will appear at the bottom of the page,
providing you with options to adjust the font size, tracking
(horizontal spacing), and line height for that specific component.
To return to the default settings for a text component, click the "reset"
icon option in the popup.

The [editable text component code](https://github.com/nanxstats/ost/tree/main/assets/ctxedit)
is derived from "CtxEdit" used on the [Inter samples website](https://rsms.me/inter/samples/)
([GitHub repo](https://github.com/rsms/inter/tree/master/docs)) by Rasmus Andersson.
The main change here is we disabled the [dynamic tracking feature](https://rsms.me/inter/dynmetrics/)
so that the parameters (font size, tracking, and line height) are decoupled in the sample text.
