# Slab Serif

Slab serif typefaces share the straightforwardness of sans serifs with a touch of serif tradition. Most slab serifs lean more towards sans serifs with their even and unchanging line thickness, giving them a clean and modern look. They are strong and noticeable, perfect for making a bold statement in your design.
