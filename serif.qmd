# Serif

Serif typefaces are where classic elegance meets modern sophistication.
These fonts feature small decorative strokes, or serifs, at the ends of
the letterforms, offering a timeless appearance that exudes
professionalism and refinement.
Serif fonts are perfect for crafting immersive reading experiences and
establishing a sense of trust and credibility in your projects.
