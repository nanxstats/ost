# Monospace

Each character in a monospace typeface occupies the same horizontal space,
creating a uniform and precise grid-like appearance.
Monospace fonts are ideal for code editing, displaying code snippets,
data tables, and typewriter-inspired designs, offering exceptional
readability and a sense of technical precision.
They are useful for enhancing your design with a touch of structure and clarity.
