# Small Caps

Small Caps typefaces feature capital letters designed at a lower-case scale,
creating a harmonious and visually appealing typographic composition.
Small caps fonts are perfect for adding subtle emphasis, creating elegant
headings, or enhancing the appearance of abbreviations and acronyms.
They could bring an extra touch of finesse to your designs.
